A new Flutter project.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I am leaving the run instructions here as I do not intend to use supabase for anything professional.

This is what is used to run the demo application
```
flutter run lib/main.dart --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://khmkgewkmrnkujakymlp.supabase.co --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANNON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImtobWtnZXdrbXJua3VqYWt5bWxwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2Njg5NjM3MzksImV4cCI6MTk4NDUzOTczOX0.-w66-GHlL5FP8JiYKmvWZXE70mHr1Si5GidbU5CE3ro
